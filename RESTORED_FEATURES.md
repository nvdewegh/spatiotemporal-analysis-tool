# Restored Features - Visual Exploration & 2SA Method

## Summary

Two analysis methods that were previously missing from the deployment have been fully restored:

1. **Visual Exploration (IMO)** - Interactive trajectory visualization
2. **2SA Method** - Two-Step Spatial Alignment for trajectory comparison

## What Was Restored

### 1. Visual Exploration (IMO)

This section provides comprehensive interactive visualizations of trajectory data with four different view types:

#### Features Included:

- **Static Trajectories**: Complete trajectory paths displayed on the court
  - Configurable object and configuration selection
  - Time range filtering
  - Temporal aggregation options (none, mean, median)
  - Adjustable temporal resolution
  - Optional translation to center

- **Animated Trajectories**: Watch movement evolve over time
  - Smooth Plotly animations
  - Same filtering and aggregation options as static view
  - Frame-by-frame playback controls

- **Time Point View**: Examine trajectories at specific moments
  - Interactive time slider
  - Shows trajectory history up to selected time point
  - Useful for analyzing positions at key moments

- **Average Positions**: Statistical summary visualization
  - Calculates mean position for each object
  - Shows both individual and overall averages
  - Useful for identifying central tendencies

#### Usage:
1. Select "Visual Exploration (IMO)" from the analysis method dropdown
2. Upload your trajectory CSV file
3. Choose configurations and objects to visualize
4. Set time range and aggregation parameters
5. Switch between the four visualization tabs

### 2. 2SA Method - Two-Step Spatial Alignment

This method implements spatial alignment of trajectories to enable comparison independent of absolute position.

#### Features Included:

- **Center-Aligned View**: All trajectories translated to start at court center
  - Highlights movement patterns
  - Makes it easy to compare different starting positions
  - Useful for tactical pattern recognition

- **Original View**: Trajectories in actual spatial positions
  - Shows real field positions
  - Reference for comparing with aligned view

- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Aligned and original views together
  - Direct visual comparison
  - Smaller figure sizes optimized for comparison
  - Helps understand the effect of alignment

#### What is 2SA?

Two-Step Spatial Alignment (2SA) is a technique that:
1. Takes each trajectory's starting point
2. Translates it to a common reference point (court center)
3. Preserves the relative movement pattern

This allows you to:
- Compare player movements from different starting positions
- Identify common tactical patterns
- Analyze relative movement independent of field position

#### Usage:
1. Select "2SA Method" from the analysis method dropdown
2. Upload your trajectory CSV file
3. Choose configurations and objects to compare
4. Set time range and aggregation parameters
5. Use the three tabs to compare aligned vs. original trajectories

## Technical Implementation

### Visualization Functions Used

Both sections utilize existing visualization functions that were already in the codebase:

- `visualize_static()` - Static trajectory plotting
- `visualize_animated()` - Animated trajectory visualization
- `visualize_at_time()` - Time-point specific visualization
- `visualize_average_position()` - Statistical position visualization

These functions already supported the `translate_to_center` parameter for 2SA alignment.

### Code Structure

The implementations follow the same pattern as other analysis methods:

```python
elif analysis_method == "Visual Exploration (IMO)":
    # Configuration selection UI
    # Time range controls
    # Aggregation parameters
    # Tabbed visualization interface
    
elif analysis_method == "2SA Method":
    # Configuration selection UI
    # Time range controls
    # Aggregation parameters
    # Comparison tabs (aligned vs original)
```

## What Changed

### Before
- "Visual Exploration (IMO)" and "2SA Method" appeared in the dropdown menu but had no implementation
- Selecting these options would show only CSV format documentation
- No visualizations were available for these methods

### After
- Both methods now have full implementations
- "Visual Exploration (IMO)" provides 4 different visualization types
- "2SA Method" provides alignment comparison functionality
- All visualizations are interactive using Plotly
- Proper error handling and user feedback included

## Deployment Status

✅ Changes committed to GitHub repository
✅ Pushed to main branch
✅ Streamlit Cloud will auto-deploy the update

Once Streamlit Cloud completes its automatic deployment (usually takes 1-2 minutes), the restored features will be available to all users at your deployment URL.

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment completes, verify the following:

1. **Visual Exploration (IMO)**:
   - [ ] Can select method from dropdown
   - [ ] Upload CSV file works
   - [ ] All 4 tabs display properly
   - [ ] Static trajectories render correctly
   - [ ] Animated trajectories play smoothly
   - [ ] Time point slider works
   - [ ] Average positions calculated correctly

2. **2SA Method**:
   - [ ] Can select method from dropdown
   - [ ] Upload CSV file works
   - [ ] All 3 tabs display properly
   - [ ] Aligned view translates trajectories to center
   - [ ] Original view shows actual positions
   - [ ] Side-by-side comparison displays both views

3. **Other Methods** (verify they still work):
   - [ ] Heat Maps
   - [ ] Clustering (all 7 steps)
   - [ ] Extra methods

## Student Instructions

You can now confidently share these features with your students:

1. **For exploring trajectory data visually**: Use "Visual Exploration (IMO)"
2. **For comparing movement patterns**: Use "2SA Method"
3. **For grouping similar trajectories**: Use "Clustering"
4. **For pass network analysis**: Use "Heat Maps"

All features are now fully functional and deployed!

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems with the restored features, check:

1. Streamlit Cloud deployment status (should show "Running")
2. Browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. CSV file format matches expected structure
4. At least one configuration and one object are selected

The visualization functions are robust and include error handling, so any issues should display helpful error messages in the app.
