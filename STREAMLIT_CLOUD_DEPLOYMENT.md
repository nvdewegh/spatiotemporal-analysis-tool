## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Your App

### View App Dashboard

Go to https://share.streamlit.io/

You can:
- **View logs**: See errors and activity
- **Reboot app**: Restart if it crashes

## üìä Resource Limits (Free Tier)

Streamlit Community Cloud is free but has limits:

- **1 GB RAM** per app
- **1 CPU** per app
- **Unlimited** public apps
- Apps sleep after **7 days** of inactivity (auto-wake on visit)

**For this tool**: The free tier is sufficient for educational use with typical trajectory datasets (<1000 trajectories).

---

## üîí Making Repository Public (Required)

Streamlit Cloud requires **public** GitHub repositories for free hosting.

To check/make your repo public:

1. Go to: https://github.com/nvdewegh/spatiotemporal-analysis-tool
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll to bottom ‚Üí **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Change visibility** ‚Üí **Make public**

## üéØ Two Options for Students

### Option A: Use Cloud Version (Recommended for most)
**Pros**: No installation, instant access
**Cons**: Requires internet, shares server resources
**Best for**: Quick analyses, demonstrations, students without Python experience

### Option B: Download and Run Locally
**Pros**: Full control, works offline, faster for large datasets
**Cons**: Requires Python installation
**Best for**: Heavy computational work, students learning Python

You can offer both options!
